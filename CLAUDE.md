## What This Project Is

A single-person quantitative research system for BTC algorithmic trading strategies.
Built in phases: data infrastructure → backtesting → AI-assisted strategy mining → paper trading → live.

**Current status:** Phase 2A in progress — building AI-free infrastructure (factor
library, DSL compiler, hypothesis hash, regime holdout integration) in preparation
for AI-assisted strategy mining in Phase 2B.

**Completed phases:**
- Phase 0: Data infrastructure (validated BTC 1h data from 2020-01 onward)
- Phase 1A: Single-run Backtrader engine with 7bps effective cost model
- Phase 1B: Walk-forward orchestration + 4 baseline strategies + heuristic DSR

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.11+** with dependencies pinned in `pyproject.toml`
- **Parquet** for all time-series market data (research layer)
- **SQLite** for experiment registry, paper trading state, and spend ledger (operational layer)
- **CCXT** for exchange API access (incremental data updates, future live trading)
- **Binance Vision** for bulk historical data download
- **Backtrader 1.9.78+** for event-driven backtesting
- **scipy** for statistical computations (Sharpe ratio, etc.)
- **matplotlib** for equity curve visualization (optional, debugging only)
- **pydantic v2** for DSL schema validation (Phase 2+)
- **Claude API via `anthropic` SDK** — Sonnet for both Proposer and Critic in Phase 2.
  Haiku is NOT used in Phase 2 (reserved for potential Phase 2.5 semantic dedup)

## Document Conflict Priority

If any two documents in this project contradict each other, resolve by this hierarchy (highest priority first):

1. **`config/execution.yaml`** — execution semantics and fee assumptions
2. **`config/environments.yaml`** — date splits and research discipline (now at `v2` with regime holdout)
3. **`config/schemas.yaml`** — column definitions and validation rules
4. **`CLAUDE.md`** (this file) — hard constraints and prohibitions
5. **`data_dictionary.md`** — human-readable schema reference
6. **`PHASE2_BLUEPRINT.md`** (v2) — Phase 2 implementation plan (current phase)
7. **`PHASE1_BLUEPRINT.md`** — Phase 1 reference (completed)
8. **`PHASE0_BLUEPRINT.md`** — Phase 0 reference (completed)

Structured config files are the machine-readable source of truth. This file governs behavior and prohibitions but does not outrank the actual config values. If you encounter a conflict, follow the higher-priority document and flag the inconsistency in a code comment.

## Execution Convention (CRITICAL — READ BEFORE WRITING ANY STRATEGY CODE)

All backtests in this project follow these rules without exception:

1. **Signal timing:** Signals are computed using data available at bar N's close.
2. **Execution timing:** Orders execute at bar N+1's open price. NEVER at bar N's close.
3. **No same-bar execution:** A strategy CANNOT observe a bar's close and execute at that same bar's close. This is look-ahead bias.
4. **Cost model (Phase 1-2):** Effective cost = **7bps per side** (14bps round trip). This is a simplification of 4bps taker fee + 3bps slippage. Do NOT treat this as a realistic execution simulator — it is an effective cost model for baseline validation. The `fee_model` registry field must be `"effective_7bps_per_side"`. Upgrading to a volatility-scaled slippage model is deferred to Phase 3.
5. **Stop/limit orders within a bar:** If both stop-loss and take-profit would trigger within the same OHLCV bar, assume the adverse one triggers first (conservative).
6. **Zero-volume fill deferral:** If the designated fill bar has `volume == 0`, defer execution to the next bar with `volume > 0`, using that bar's open price. If deferral exceeds 24 bars (24 hours), cancel the order entirely.
7. **All times are UTC.** No exceptions. No implicit local timezone conversions.

These rules are defined in `config/execution.yaml` and enforced by `backtest/execution_model.py`.

## Phase-specific execution rules

Phase-specific execution rules (Backtrader-specific configuration, Factor parquet rules, Phase 2 DSL/Agent/Budget rules, Raw payload audit retention, Library policy) are at [docs/rules/phase_execution_rules.md](docs/rules/phase_execution_rules.md). Canonical HARD CONSTRAINTS section below remains authoritative.

## Timestamp & Timezone Rules

- **ALL timestamps in code, data, logs, and configs are UTC.**
- Parquet columns: use timezone-aware `datetime64[ms, UTC]`.
- SQLite columns: store as ISO 8601 strings with `Z` suffix (e.g., `2024-01-15T08:00:00Z`).
- Column naming convention: all time columns end in `_utc` (e.g., `open_time_utc`, `ingested_at_utc`, `created_at_utc`).
- Python code: always use `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`, NEVER `datetime.now()` or `datetime.utcnow()`.
- Pandas: when reading timestamps, always pass `utc=True` or explicitly localize with `.dt.tz_localize('UTC')`.
- **NEVER mix timezone-aware and timezone-naive datetimes.** This will silently corrupt data joins and backtest alignment.
- **Phase 2 budget**: "month" is strictly a **UTC calendar month** for monthly cap purposes. A new month begins at `YYYY-MM-01T00:00:00Z`. NEVER use a rolling 30-day window for budget accounting.

## Data Rules

- `data/raw/btcusdt_1h.parquet` is the **canonical current dataset**. It is overwritten by `reconcile.py` after each update.
- Before overwriting, `reconcile.py` MUST archive the previous version to `data/raw/archive/btcusdt_1h_YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ.parquet`.
- Raw data is NEVER modified by any process other than `reconcile.py`. Strategies, agents, and analysis scripts read only.
- `open_time_utc` is the primary key for all OHLCV data. It must be unique and sorted ascending.
- Zero-volume bars are flagged in validation reports but NOT auto-removed. They may indicate exchange downtime or data-quality issues.
- Missing bars (gaps) are flagged but NOT auto-interpolated. Forward-filling is PROHIBITED.
- All data files include `source` ("binance_vision", "ccxt_binance", or "ccxt_binanceus") and `ingested_at_utc` columns.

## Experiment Tracking

- Every backtest run MUST be logged in `backtest/experiments.db` (SQLite).
- Required fields per run: `run_id`, `run_type`, `parent_run_id`, `strategy_name`, `git_commit`, `config_hash`, `split_version`, `data_snapshot_date`, `train_start`, `train_end`, `effective_start`, `warmup_bars`, `validation_start`, `validation_end`, `test_start`, `test_end`, `initial_capital`, `final_capital`, core metrics, `fee_model`.
- **Phase 2 additional fields**: `batch_id`, `hypothesis_hash`, `regime_holdout_passed`, `lifecycle_state`, `feature_version`.
- `run_type` must be one of: `"single_run"`, `"walk_forward_window"`, `"walk_forward_summary"`, `"regime_holdout"`, `"batch_summary"`
- `fee_model` for Phase 1-2: `"effective_7bps_per_side"` — do NOT use labels that imply separate fee/slippage modeling
- `split_version` for Phase 2: `"v2"` (train = 2020-2021 + 2023; holdout = 2022; validation = 2024; test = 2025)
- The experiment registry is the system of record for all research results.

## Date Split Rules

- Train/validation/test date boundaries are defined in `config/environments.yaml`.
- These boundaries are IMMUTABLE during a research phase.
- Strategies may ONLY be trained/optimized on data within the training window.
- Validation data is for hyperparameter selection and early stopping only.
- Test data is touched ONCE for final evaluation. If you peek and iterate, it becomes validation data.
- **Phase 2 regime holdout (2022)**: an additional in-train stress test. Agents never see its results. Only hypotheses that pass `regime_holdout_passed` advance to validation. See D4 in `PHASE2_BLUEPRINT.md` for the 4-condition passing criteria.

## HARD CONSTRAINTS — THINGS CLAUDE CODE MUST NEVER DO

These are non-negotiable rules. Violating any of these invalidates research results.

### Data Integrity
- ❌ NEVER modify `config/environments.yaml` (date splits are immutable)
- ❌ NEVER modify `config/execution.yaml` without explicit human approval
- ❌ NEVER write to `data/raw/btcusdt_1h.parquet` from any script other than `reconcile.py`
- ❌ NEVER forward-fill missing bars or interpolate prices
- ❌ NEVER silently drop or filter rows from raw data
- ❌ NEVER auto-remove zero-volume bars (flag only)

### Execution Integrity
- ❌ NEVER assume same-bar execution (signal on close, execute on same close)
- ❌ NEVER hardcode transaction costs in strategy code — read from execution.yaml
- ❌ NEVER write strategies that access future data (no `shift(-1)` on price data for signals)
- ❌ NEVER use test-set performance to modify strategy parameters
- ❌ NEVER set `cheat_on_close=True` or `cheat_on_open=True` in Backtrader Cerebro
- ❌ NEVER fill orders on zero-volume bars — defer to next valid bar
- ❌ NEVER allow trades during the warmup period
- ❌ NEVER compute metrics (Sharpe, drawdown, etc.) including the warmup period
- ❌ NEVER use Backtrader's naive datetimes without converting to UTC for comparisons

### Factor & Vectorization Integrity (Phase 2)
- ❌ NEVER use global aggregations (`.mean()`, `.std()` on full series) in factor compute functions — use `.rolling(N)` or `.ewm(span=N, adjust=False)` only
- ❌ NEVER use future-touching operations in factors: `shift(-k)`, `bfill`, `fillna(method='bfill')`, unbounded `expanding()` without a minimum constraint that excludes future bars
- ❌ NEVER register a factor as a lambda, nested function, or dynamically-generated callable — top-level named functions only
- ❌ NEVER build factor parquet for a subset of dates — always full dataset; subsetting is a consumption-layer concern
- ❌ NEVER read a factor parquet whose stored `feature_version` mismatches the live registry hash — force rebuild instead
- ❌ NEVER modify a docstring and expect `feature_version` to change — docstrings are excluded from the hash

### DSL Compiler Integrity (Phase 2)
- ❌ NEVER translate `crosses_above` / `crosses_below` as a naive single-bar comparison; must use `bt.indicators.CrossOver` or explicit two-bar form
- ❌ NEVER merge factor-vs-scalar and factor-vs-factor into a single code path — they are separate with independent tests
- ❌ NEVER let NaN in a comparison evaluate to `True` or short-circuit; NaN is always `False`
- ❌ NEVER add a compiler special case for a specific baseline; if DSL cannot express a baseline, revise the DSL schema instead
- ❌ NEVER silently regenerate a compilation manifest on drift; drift raises and requires explicit human-acknowledged regeneration
- ❌ NEVER allow a DSL to compile to a strategy that uses negative shifts or intrabar reads of close

### AI Agent & Prompt Integrity (Phase 2)
- ❌ NEVER include validation (2024), test (2025), or regime-holdout (2022) metrics/data in any prompt context sent to an LLM, even after the fact
- ❌ NEVER include raw per-hypothesis numeric results (Sharpe, return, drawdown) in Proposer context — only aggregate stats and DSL-only examples
- ❌ NEVER use Haiku for Critic in Phase 2 — Critic requires Sonnet-level reasoning
- ❌ NEVER bypass the Critic — all approved hypotheses must pass through it
- ❌ NEVER let `overfitting_risk_score >= 4` produce an `approve` verdict — force reject in orchestrator code
- ❌ NEVER implement a Critic `refine` verdict in Phase 2 (v2 removed it; reconsider for Phase 2.5 if needed)

### Budget & Lifecycle Integrity (Phase 2)
- ❌ NEVER modify `agents/spend_ledger.db` from any script other than the orchestrator
- ❌ NEVER interpret "month" as a rolling 30-day window — strictly UTC calendar month
- ❌ NEVER perform a budget check AFTER an API call (must be pre-call)
- ❌ NEVER resume a batch that was marked `crashed` in the ledger
- ❌ NEVER use `hypotheses_approved` as N for DSR — always `hypotheses_attempted` from batch_summary
- ❌ NEVER assign `shortlisted` lifecycle state outside D9's `finalize_batch()`; orchestrator writes `pending_dsr` and stops
- ❌ NEVER check the lifecycle invariant mid-batch; it only holds at batch close
- ❌ NEVER stitch disjoint train-window equity curves into a single continuous series for metric computation

### Regime Holdout Integrity (Phase 2)
- ❌ NEVER expose a general-purpose CLI for regime holdout execution — orchestrator-internal only
- ❌ NEVER let the Proposer or Critic see regime holdout results in any form
- ❌ NEVER include 2022 bars in any walk-forward training window
- ❌ NEVER mark `regime_holdout_passed = True` unless ALL four criteria are met: `sharpe >= -0.5 AND max_dd <= 0.25 AND total_return >= -0.15 AND total_trades >= 5`

### Critic Integrity (Phase 2 D7)
- ❌ NEVER let `run_critic()` raise an exception — all failures are captured in `critic_status` codes
- ❌ NEVER modify D7a rule score formulas without updating the edge behavior table in `test_d7a_rules.py`
- ❌ NEVER let D7a rule scores fall outside `[0.0, 1.0]` or use more than 4 decimal places
- ❌ NEVER return `d7a_rule_scores = {k: 0.0}` when the score is unknown — use `None` for unknown, `0.0` for measured-as-bad
- ❌ NEVER enforce the reliability fuse in Stage 1 — `CRITIC_RELIABILITY_FUSE_ENFORCED` must remain `False` until Stage 2
- ❌ NEVER add critic_result to per-call records when `with_critic=False` — output must be byte-identical to pre-D7 behavior
- ❌ NEVER let the critic influence `approved_examples` window — critic annotates only, never filters
- ❌ NEVER enable prompt caching for D7b calls — this is a CONTRACT BOUNDARY (locked at Stage 2a)
- ❌ NEVER retry D7b content-level errors (malformed JSON, schema violation, refusal) — zero retries; these are forensic signals
- ❌ NEVER let D7b live backend share the D6 Proposer's `anthropic.Anthropic()` client — separate client is a CONTRACT BOUNDARY
- ❌ NEVER modify D7b prompt template wording without a new locked decision — frozen within a Stage 2 run
- ❌ NEVER omit `backend_kind` or `call_role` from `write_pending()` — both are required with no defaults
- ❌ NEVER co-mingle dry-run artifacts with production `raw_payloads/` — use `dryrun_payloads/` with physical isolation

### Conservative-Anchor Gate Integrity (Phase B Tier 5/6 per R3.1d V_SEAL 2026-05-19)
- ❌ NEVER promote a candidate strategy to Phase B Tier 5 evaluation without `holdout_sharpe > 0` strict pass at `spot_realistic_15bps_v1` anchor (via `config/execution_phaseb_spot_15bps.yaml`; 15 bps/side = 30 bps round trip)
- ❌ NEVER promote a candidate strategy to Phase B Tier 6 (R6.1 promotion class) without FWER-style multiplicity correction pass — eligible instruments: Deflated Sharpe Ratio per Bailey-López de Prado 2014 (preferred); Romano-Wolf stepdown; Westfall-Young permutation FWER; heuristic DSR `sqrt(2*ln(N))` acceptable interim screen only (supersession to production-grade required before final capital commitment)
- ❌ NEVER use Benjamini-Hochberg FDR (BH-FDR) at Tier 6 — controls FDR (expected proportion of false discoveries) not FWER (probability of any false discovery); per-strategy capital commitment under this project's serial individual-allocation architecture (no cross-strategy portfolio diversification at deployment) requires FWER framework
- ❌ NEVER use Phase 1-2 `effective_7bps_per_side` results as Tier 5/6 promotion basis under formal Branch.A SPOT commitment (per R4.1 SEAL + R3.1d V_SEAL tiered Pillar 1 policy SD3-D)
- ❌ NEVER modify `config/execution_phaseb_spot_15bps.yaml` without explicit human approval (parallel rule to `config/execution.yaml` Data Integrity)
- ❌ NEVER omit `cost_anchor_id` from `experiment_registry.runs` entries on new Phase B / Tier 5 / Tier 6 runs once schema migration lands (per R3.1d §5.2; mapping table path-keyed at `execution_config_path` → `cost_anchor_id`)
- ❌ NEVER lock Tier 6 multiplicity instrument variant + threshold + N value at R3.1d V_SEAL; these are pre-committed for R6.1 V_SEAL based on cohort properties at R6.1 fire time

### Code Quality
- ❌ NEVER generate a factor/indicator function without a docstring specifying: inputs, computation method, warmup period, output schema, and null policy
- ❌ NEVER skip validation steps when ingesting or updating data
- ❌ NEVER commit code that doesn't pass existing tests

---

## Coding Standards

- All scripts have `if __name__ == "__main__"` with argparse
- All scripts support `--dry-run` where applicable
- All scripts log to stdout with ISO 8601 UTC timestamps
- All functions have type hints and docstrings
- All data-modifying operations are logged (what changed, row counts before/after)
- Non-zero exit code on any validation failure
- Use `pathlib.Path` for all file paths, never string concatenation
- Config loading: use a shared utility that reads YAML once and passes as dict

## Contract Markers

Three grep-discoverable comment markers document contract obligations in code:

- `CONTRACT GAP` — a test or mechanism that should exist but doesn't yet,
  with a trigger condition that will require adding it (e.g., "widening
  this Literal requires adding test_X in the same PR"). Use
  `rg "CONTRACT GAP"` to list all pending gaps.
- `CONTRACT BOUNDARY` — a deliberate separation between two mechanisms
  that look mergeable but must stay separate (e.g., D2 manifest
  canonicalization vs D3 dedup canonicalization). Mutual cross-references
  required.
- `DESIGN INVARIANT` — a non-obvious design decision that future readers
  might mistake for a bug (e.g., cross operators delay first-firable bar
  by 1). Explain the rationale at the site.

When introducing a contract obligation that can't be closed immediately,
tag it with one of these markers rather than a TODO or a checklist entry
in a separate document. Markers at the code site are self-maintaining;
external checklists are not.

Use these markers **sparingly**, for true contract obligations and
design boundaries — not for routine implementation notes. If the marker
points at something that will be fixed in the next PR, it's a regular
TODO, not a contract marker. Contract markers exist for obligations
whose trigger condition is **external to the current PR's scope**
(e.g., "when Literal X is widened", "when parallel execution is
added", "when a later phase begins"). Prefer placing the marker at the
exact code site where the invariant or future-trigger condition matters,
not at a distant wrapper or caller.

## Known Data Characteristics

The canonical dataset (`data/raw/btcusdt_1h.parquet`) has these stable, verified properties:
- Dataset begins at **2020-01-01 00:00 UTC** and is extended via incremental CCXT updates
- **31 known missing hours** across 15 gap windows, all in 2020-2023 (historical exchange outages, verified stable across rebuilds)
- **3 known zero-volume bars** (2020-12-21, 2021-02-11, 2023-03-24) — all adjacent to gaps, all have O=H=L=C (frozen price)
- In currently validated snapshots, no gaps or zero-volume bars have been observed from 2024 onward
- All timestamps are UTC-aware and hour-aligned
- Exact row counts and source coverage boundaries change with each incremental update — check validation reports in `data/quality/` for current snapshot details

## Phase Marker (update as work progresses)

**Discipline rule:** this section must be updated in the same arc that ships any phase/stage sign-off, major closeout, or live batch fire. Stale Phase Marker misleads future work.

- **Current phase:** R2.3 Theme Tag Provenance Verification cycle (R2.3 = Phase B Pre-Sequence Roadmap V3 Tier 2 substantive cycle Bucket-1 Template B per β3 hybrid lock; structural analog to R2.0 + R2.1 + R3.1d + R4.1 + §34 SEAL cycles; sister cycle to R2.1 under R2.0 SD-B B2 Tier 2 SEAL prereq pair; fired by Charlie 2026-05-20 as register-event "R2.3 substantive cycle authorized") **SEALED** at R2.3 V_SEAL register-event boundary 2026-05-20 (canonical R2.3 artifact at [`docs/phase5/R2_3_THEME_TAG_PROVENANCE_NOTE.md`](docs/phase5/R2_3_THEME_TAG_PROVENANCE_NOTE.md) sealed at R2.3 V_SEAL bundle commit `fc577d9` + this Phase Marker advance commit; R2.3 ≈ 330 lines / 12 main §§ + cycle metadata header + β3 hybrid Phase A §11 Errata E2 cross-reference append at `docs/phase5/PHASE5_A_CLARIFICATION_NOTE.md`). **Tier 2 SEAL COMPLETE:** R2.3 V_SEAL completes Tier 2 SEAL per R2.0 SD-B B2 lock (R2.1 ✓ + R2.3 ✓); R5.1 cycle entry now unlocked at separate Charlie register-event boundary per anti-pre-emption + R2.0/R2.1/R2.3 SEAL precedent. **Locked sub-decisions (Charlie register chain through V_SEAL 2026-05-20):** Round-1 sub-decision menu = α2 (4-dimensional ((a) authorship + (b) timing + (c) audit trail + (d) cross-artifact consistency) with dim (d) INDETERMINATE-DSL-UNAVAILABLE per Sub-1 η1-C extension) + β3 (hybrid: standalone canonical artifact + Phase A §11 Errata E2 cross-reference append; Codex+orchestrator pushback lean ratified post-DIVERGED-narrow vs Advisor β1) + γ1 (explicit §34 first-empirical-test section ~30 lines per Advisor scoping discipline) + δ1 (population-wide INDETERMINATE-DSL-UNAVAILABLE for all 39 candidates' dim (d) — **first cross-cycle re-use** of R2.1 Sub-1 η1-C verdict-vocabulary extension validates standing-discipline status). **R2.3 substantive outcome:** Phase A V4 OBS 10 binary framing RESOLVED via **three-layer reshape** (per Codex Round-1 SF3): Layer 1 (timing) themes assigned at GENERATION TIME at BatchContext construction BEFORE Proposer LLM call; Layer 2 (authorship) programmatic ROTATION LOGIC at `agents/proposer/stage2c_batch.py:213` formula `THEMES[(k - 1) % THEME_CYCLE_LEN]`; Layer 3 (constraint) Proposer LLM receives theme as prompt directive at `prompt_builder.py:227` (LLM constrained, NOT choosing). dim (a) authorship PASS + dim (b) timing PASS + dim (c) audit trail PASS + dim (d) cross-artifact consistency INDETERMINATE-DSL-UNAVAILABLE per Sub-1 η1-C (0/5 cohort_a source batches accessible in raw_payloads/ — identical R2.1 DSL persistence gap pattern). **4 finding-class observations surfaced per §8 (eligible-not-named per anti-pre-emption):** R2.3-A three-layer mechanism + R2.3-B theme tags = PROMPT-ROTATION PROVENANCE LABELS not validated content-aware classifications (Stage 2 telemetry at stage2c_batch.py:409-445 quantifies factor-theme overlap gap) + R2.3-C cohort_a 22/7/6/2/2 distribution = SELECTION pattern at AND-gate terminus NOT GENERATION pattern + R2.3-D multi_factor_combination theme excluded from current operational rotation (THEME_CYCLE_LEN = 5 vs THEMES tuple = 6). **§34 first-empirical-test codified per γ1 (R2.3 §7):** R2.3 is FIRST cycle since §34 codification (commits `39f0727` + `60b60a0` 2026-05-20); §34 application surfaced raw_payloads gap pre-commit; §34 Step 5 lock-choice (c) "lock with INDETERMINATE-on-data-unavailability classification" applied via δ1; first cross-cycle re-use of Sub-1 η1-C vocabulary extension validates standing-discipline status. **5 Charlie register fires across R2.3 cycle through V_SEAL:** (1) cycle entry "R2.3 substantive cycle authorized" 2026-05-20; (2) Round-1 sub-decision menu lock "SD-α α2 + SD-β β3 + SD-γ γ1 + SD-δ δ1 ratify" 2026-05-20 (post-2-leg reviewer round CONVERGED on α2/γ1/δ1 + DIVERGED-narrow-on-β with Codex β3 + orchestrator pushback β3 ratified); (3) V2 patch list lock + PFR-rule-Y FIRE + V_SEAL conditional pre-authorization "V2 ADOPT (V2-P1 + V2-P2 + V2-P3 + V2-P5 + V2-P7) / PFR-rule-Y FIRE / V_SEAL conditionally pre-authorize on clean PFR Authorized" 2026-05-20; (4) V3 patches lock + V3 mini-PFR FIRE "V3 ADOPT + V3 mini-PFR FIRE" 2026-05-20 (post-PFR returned BLOCK on V2-P1 incomplete §11 + §10.1 circular pre-claim + §10.3 denominator drift); (5) V_SEAL fire "V_SEAL fire on V3-NIT-P1 + finalization edits authorized" 2026-05-20 (post-V3-mini-PFR APPROVE-V_SEAL convergent). **Adjudication register at V_SEAL:** 4 reviewer rounds × 2-leg subagent default = 8 individual dispatches (Round-1 sub-decision menu + V1 reviewer round + PFR round + V3 mini-PFR); 0/8 stalls; **0/8 Codex hallucinations cycle-internal**; **0/8 Advisor hallucinations cycle-internal**. Codex caught load-bearing precision drifts at Round-1 + V1 F1 BLOCKING V-state contradiction (Advisor missed under γ1/§7 own-finding-anchoring) + PFR-NEW-F1 §11 stale. Advisor caught V1 F1 BLOCKING `_resolve_theme`→`_theme_for_position` function name drift + PFR-NEW-F1 §10.1 circular pre-claim + PFR-NEW-F4 §10.3 denominator drift. **4th empirical instance of own-finding-anchoring pattern** at R2.3 V1 (Codex caught V-state contradiction Advisor missed); cross-cycle precedent: R2.0 V2-P6 + R3.1d V2-P5 + §34 V1 + R2.3 V1. **B2 standing rule LOCKED 2026-05-19** further empirically validated through 4 rounds. **Codex + Advisor opus pilot data through R2.3:** Codex cumulative R3.1d + R2.0 + R2.1 + §34 + R2.3 = **1/18** verified cite hallucinations (~5.6%; single instance at §34 PFR-NEW-F2). Advisor opus pilot N=13 through R2.3 = **0/13** verified hallucinations post-/agents-fix opus regime. **Option 1A atomicity binding empirical 15th trigger:** this Phase Marker advance commit atomically updates `docs/phase_marker_history.md` per Option 1A binding (`feedback_claude_md_freshness.md`); 15th trigger — cross-cycle robustness now 15-instance validated. **Active next action:** R2.3 SEAL bundle pushed (2 commits: SEAL artifact commit `fc577d9` includes Phase A §11 Errata E2 per β3 hybrid + this Phase Marker advance commit with atomic history file update); **R5.1 Phase B candidate-subset commitment under SPOT** (Tier 2 SEAL gate NOW PASSED at R2.3 V_SEAL; eligible-not-named at separate Charlie register-event per anti-pre-emption) + R5.2 (selection-inflation handling; gated behind R5.1) + R6.1 (Tier 6 promotion class REQUIRED per R3.1d SD9; N treatment α/β/γ per R2.0 SD-C C1; gated behind R5.1/R5.2) + R3.1b/c (eligible when Phase 4 paper-trading deploys per R3.1d §8) + R2.2 (Monday-pattern mechanism investigation; eligible-not-named WITH Monday-candidate guard at R5.1 V_SEAL lock per SD-B B2) + P2a DSL recovery (eligible-not-named separate Charlie register per Sub-2 β; could also resolve R2.3 dim (d) INDETERMINATE; ~$3-8 API spend) + mechanism investigation for FLIP-TRIGGERED candidates (per SD-A A1 dim c action menu + V3-P1 anti-rescue) + memory update for first Codex SEAL-class hallucination + 4th own-finding-anchoring pattern instance (forward-only observation in `feedback_reviewer_routing_subagent_default.md` cumulative reliability data) + advisor /agents-UI second refresh + Tier-0 pause + Phase 2.5 bandit-dedup (parked) + pre-existing noise cleanup (.DS_Store + docs/d7_stage2c/* 15+ session carry-forward) + advisor opus model effects pilot extended observation (R2.3 cycle adds N=4 advisor dispatch data points all with 0 hallucinations) + other Charlie-specified — all eligible at separate Charlie register-event boundary per anti-pre-emption + Phase 5.1/5.2/Phase A/R1.2/R3.1a/R4.1/R3.1d/R2.0/R2.1/§34/R2.3 SEAL precedent. **NO tag** per Bucket-1 substantive cycle ≠ arc-level closeout. _§34 codification cycle entry detail (full verbatim) preserved at [`docs/phase_marker_history.md`](docs/phase_marker_history.md) per sealed-content invariance + Phase Marker compactness discipline._

- **Active blueprint:** `blueprint/PHASE2_BLUEPRINT.md` (v2; **freshness note** added at top per Option B at commit `3a554fb` documenting D9 + post-D9 evaluation framework supersession by PHASE2C_3-9 arc series; CLAUDE.md Phase Marker remains operational source of truth)
- **Current batch_id:** `b6fcbf86-4d57-4d1f-ae41-1778296b1ae9` (Phase 2C Phase 1 walk-forward; corrected-engine re-run in `_corrected/` directory is canonical; same batch consumed by PHASE2C_6 single-regime evaluation runs at `data/phase2c_evaluation_gate/{smoke,primary,audit}_v1/`, by PHASE2C_7.1 multi-regime evaluation runs at `data/phase2c_evaluation_gate/{audit_2024_v1, audit_2024_v1_filtered, comparison_2022_vs_2024_v1}/`, and by PHASE2C_8.1 extended multi-regime evaluation runs at `data/phase2c_evaluation_gate/{eval_2020_v1, eval_2020_v1_filtered, eval_2021_v1, eval_2021_v1_filtered, audit_v1_filtered, comparison_2022_2024_2020_2021_v1}/`)
- **Current UTC-month spend (May 2026):** ~$19.66 (10 batches, all status `completed`; covers PHASE2C_15 cohort_a AND-gate fires + Phase 4 forward persistence test cost-runs at 7/13/15/17 bps + earlier Phase 2C iteration / smoke batches; per `agents/spend_ledger.db` `ledger` table, queried 2026-05-17; last API call 2026-05-09; Phase 5 + Phase 5.1 work to date is local-only with no API spend)
- **Hard rule for any future WF-consuming work:** must consume corrected artifacts only and call `backtest.wf_lineage.check_wf_semantics_or_raise()` before computing derived metrics from walk-forward summaries. For single-run holdout artifacts (PHASE2C_6 attestation domain `single_run_holdout_v1`), use the companion guard `backtest.wf_lineage.check_evaluation_semantics_or_raise()`. See [`docs/decisions/WF_TEST_BOUNDARY_SEMANTICS.md`](docs/decisions/WF_TEST_BOUNDARY_SEMANTICS.md) Section RS for the corrected-engine consumption discipline that governs both attestation domains.

## Project-discipline notes

Standing project-discipline principles (apply across all work cycles, not bound to a phase) are codified at [`docs/discipline/METHODOLOGY_NOTES.md`](docs/discipline/METHODOLOGY_NOTES.md). Seven principles currently in force: §1 empirical verification for factual claims, §2 meta-claim verification discipline, §3 regime-aware calibration bands, §4 scale-step discipline for empirical evaluations, §5 precondition verification for structural and organizational principles, §6 commit messages are not canonical result layers, §7 asymmetric confidence reporting on multi-sample claims. §8 is the synthesis "How to apply these principles" section. The §4-§7 additions were codified during the PHASE2C_6 evaluation gate arc (commit `536f737`). Future cycles append new lessons as additional sections.

## Parked branches

Branches containing completed-but-not-yet-merged work are registered at [`docs/parked/PARKED_BRANCHES.md`](docs/parked/PARKED_BRANCHES.md), with activation trigger conditions and pre-merge verification checklist per parked branch. Currently parked: `phase2.5/bandit-dedup` (factor bandit Track A + semantic dedup Track B; combined Option-1 Path-3-style cycle authorized 2026-05-16; awaiting batch cadence resumption per Concern 1 isolation strategy).
